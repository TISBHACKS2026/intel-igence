StreetSafe 🛣️🧠

StreetSafe is a Python + Web-based project developed for TISB Hacks 2026.
The project combines backend Python processing with a simple frontend interface to analyze map-based data and assess road-related risks.

Overview

StreetSafe focuses on processing and analyzing location and road data using Python, with outputs that can be visualized or interacted with through a lightweight web interface.

The project includes Python scripts for map handling and road risk analysis, a basic HTML/CSS frontend, and backend logic with cached data for efficient processing.

Tech Stack

Python for core logic and analysis
HTML and CSS for the frontend interface
Additional Python libraries listed in requirements.txt

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate into it.

Create a virtual environment (recommended).

Install the required dependencies using the requirements file.

Running the Project

Run the Python scripts directly as needed for analysis and testing.

Open index.html in a web browser to view the frontend.

If the backend is connected to the frontend, ensure the relevant Python scripts are running before interacting with the web interface.

Notes

The .venv folder is included for local development.
.DS_Store is macOS-generated and not required.
Python scripts can be executed independently for development and testing.
